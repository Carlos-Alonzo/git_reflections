What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a .git folder to begin the process of tracking files. This is needed in order to begin a repository and be able to sync to remote branch.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area adds a level of separation between the working folder and the repository to allow the user to select/choose what they want to be committed. The difference being that in the working directory there can be more files that one would want to commit at the time, so this allows for selecting which files to commit by bringing them to the staging area.
